# Studio 1

As with Studio 0, insert your answers to the questions in this document where indicated (and in the format requested).

# Part 0: Class policies

You should review all the class policies and post any questions or clarifications via Piazza (as a followup to the Welcome message) by Wednesday, Sept. 5.

***Q1.0 Please acknowledge that you will review the class policies and, if necessary, ask for any clarifications by Wed, Sept. 5.  Each person should type their name below to acknowledge this request:***

# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***

The mission is to create a concept where the object solves a task where a screen is usually required.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

We are designer first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

My problem: "How do you know when its going to rain?
Isn't that annoying?
Screen might not be good for you."

Their problem:
Wake up with a fever or hangover
such a pain to get out of bed
medicine far
Don't want it on nightstand
Does wear an apple watch

Fine wearing things?

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.




***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***

Wearing something to bed that warns you that you're gonna be sick in the morning.

Maybe temperature sensors in bed that detect fever, and deliver medicine to your bed.

Delivery mechanism? medicine in air. delivery from afar. calls someone to bring you medicine. pills pop up from secret place that isn't annoying on the side of the bed.

jewelry, watch,
artificial intelligent camera that can tell if your sick
candle that releases medicine

Strengths/weaknesses: having to wear something. constant info. can't necessarily tell ahead of time. still need to have delivery of medicine.
Possibly add adaptive delivery mechanism in case you fall out of bed.


## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

Doesn't like hearing all the ideas. he wants the solution.

Likes air diffusion. no action necessary.

Customer might want a simple solution or something very tangible.

maybe have a button. or ask alexa.



(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

might change solution to make it more simple and realistic.

Make it super convenient. If possible, make it so you don't even have to take pill or wake up.
Possibly extrapolate solution to include many medical problems.

Medical vapor is good realistic way to administer.
Maybe use a drone, or automated delivery by human.

Most realistic way to know if sick would be a wearable.
If not, maybe a smart camera or a infrared sensor for fever detection.

Real solution, would be wearable + vapor mechanism.


## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

User friendly

Feasibility

Utility



## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

Thinks its viable.
Innovative
Could be a wristwatch or could be something smaller
maybe have something on ankle rather than wrist since it might be bad for head.

Iteration is good


***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***


very user friendly mobile application.
responded well to things i liked.
alarm sounds.

AI.
It will meet needs. I like simple. It was not very different than thought of. But different from the card in the sense that it used audio rather than visual.


(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
  user friendly
  innovative
  creative


- Things
  watch
  jewelry
  clothing

- Services
  health
  gps
  facebook

- Feedback
  vibrate
  emoji
  change color

- Human Actions
  shake
  tilt
  rotate

- Missions
  tangibility
  trojan horse


### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***

Smart device, thing. Alexa, thing.
